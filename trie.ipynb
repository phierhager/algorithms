    "# Trie (Prefix Tree) Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Trie** (pronounced as \"try\") is a tree-like data structure that is used to efficiently store a dynamic set of strings, or associative arrays where the keys are usually strings. It is commonly used for applications like autocomplete, spell checking, and IP routing. Tries are optimized for prefix queries, making them ideal for storing a large number of strings and quickly checking for prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features of a Trie\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prefix-based searching**: Tries can quickly search for any word that begins with a given prefix.\n",
    "2. **Efficient memory usage**: A Trie stores common prefixes only once, making it more space-efficient than storing the whole word multiple times.\n",
    "3. **Fast insertion and lookup**: Both insertion and lookup operations can be performed in time proportional to the length of the word or prefix, making Tries faster than hash tables in some scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations Supported by Trie\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insert(word)**: Inserts a word into the Trie.\n",
    "2. **Search(word)**: Returns `true` if the word exists in the Trie, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "3. **startsWith(prefix)**: Returns `true` if there is any word in the Trie that starts with the given prefix, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trie Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each node in a Trie represents a single character of a string.\n",
    "- The root node is typically empty and does not represent any character.\n",
    "- Each node has multiple child nodes, each representing the next character in a word.\n",
    "- Nodes may also have a boolean flag (`is_end_of_word`) that indicates whether a word ends at that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Tries\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prefix search**: Tries are ideal for applications like autocomplete, where we need to efficiently find all words starting with a certain prefix.\n",
    "- **No hashing required**: Unlike hash tables, tries do not rely on hash functions, making them more predictable in performance.\n",
    "- **Space optimization**: Common prefixes are shared across multiple words, leading to memory savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Code Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the implementation of a Trie class in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TrieNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.children = {}\n",
    "        self.is_end_of_word = False\n",
    "\n",
    "class Trie:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.root = TrieNode()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:\n",
    "        node = self.root\n",
    "        for char in word:\n",
    "            if char not in node.children:\n",
    "                node.children[char] = TrieNode()\n",
    "            node = node.children[char]\n",
    "        node.is_end_of_word = True\n",
    "\n",
    "    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:\n",
    "        node = self.root\n",
    "        for char in word:\n",
    "            if char not in node.children:\n",
    "                return False\n",
    "            node = node.children[char]\n",
    "        return node.is_end_of_word\n",
    "\n",
    "    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:\n",
    "        node = self.root\n",
    "        for char in prefix:\n",
    "            if char not in node.children:\n",
    "                return False\n",
    "            node = node.children[char]\n",
    "        return True\n"
