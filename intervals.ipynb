    "# Interval Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervals are a common problem domain in algorithms. Many interval problems involve sorting the intervals and making decisions based on their start and end points. Below are common approaches and examples of solving interval-related problems.\n",

    "## General Approach to Interval Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort the Intervals**:\n",
    "   - Sort intervals based on their start or end times depending on the problem requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Through the Intervals**:\n",
    "   - Use a variable to track key information (e.g., the end time of the last interval).\n",
    "   - Check for overlaps, gaps, or other conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Greedy Choice**:\n",
    "   - Often, the solution involves a greedy algorithm to optimize for the smallest number of removals, the fewest arrows, or the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals.\n",

    "## Problem 1: Erase Overlap Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of intervals, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest non-overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Sort the intervals by their end times.\n",
    "- Iterate through the intervals, and if an interval overlaps with the previous one, increment the removal count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n",
    "        last_end = float(\"-inf\")  # Initialize the end of the last interval\n",
    "        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end times\n",
    "        removal_count = 0\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for start, end in intervals:\n",
    "            if start < last_end:\n",
    "                removal_count += 1  # Overlapping interval, remove it\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                last_end = end  # Update last_end for non-overlapping interval\n",

    "## Problem 2: Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an array of balloon intervals `points[i] = [xstart, xend]`, return the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons. Each arrow can burst all balloons whose horizontal diameter it intersects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Sort the intervals by their end times to minimize the number of arrows.\n",
    "- Use a greedy algorithm:\n",
    "  - Start with no arrows (`arrows = 0`) and track the position of the last arrow (`last_end = -âˆž`).\n",
    "  - For each interval:\n",
    "    - If the interval starts after `last_end`, shoot a new arrow and update `last_end` to the interval's end.\n",
    "    - If the interval overlaps with `last_end`, continue without shooting a new arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Solution:\n",
    "    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n",
    "        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by end times\n",
    "        arrows = 0\n",
    "        last_end = float('-inf')  # Initialize the last arrow's position\n",
    "        \n",
    "        for start, end in points:\n",
    "            if start > last_end:\n",
    "                arrows += 1  # Shoot a new arrow\n",
    "                last_end = end  # Update the last arrow's position\n",
