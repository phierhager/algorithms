    "\n",
    "A **monotonic stack** is a stack data structure used to maintain elements in a monotonic (increasing or decreasing) order. It is particularly useful for solving problems that involve comparisons across sequences, such as finding the next or previous greater/smaller element in \\(O(n)\\) time.\n",
